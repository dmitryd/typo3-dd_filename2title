# Fill in FAL file title from the file name

If you used TYPO3 4.x and DAM, you are used to file titles generated from file names. This is missing in TYPO3 6+ and FAL. There is even a [feature request](https://forge.typo3.org/issues/61106) about in the TYPO3 bug tracker.

Since this feature request was rejected, I decided to make a really small extension to make this popular feature available.

The extension is provided without any support or any plans for enhancements, improvements, complications, coffee machine control, etc. Just use as is. Or don't use.
